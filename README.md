# Plant Disease Detector

This project has been refactored to follow standard React best practices, including:

- All source files are now under the `src/` directory.
- Components are in `src/components/`, utilities in `src/utils/`, and services in `src/services/`.
- Modern React best practices are followed (no unnecessary React imports, direct use of hooks, improved types).
